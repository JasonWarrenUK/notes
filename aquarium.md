## Tank Problems

### Cyanobacteria

Info from [this link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/buceplant.com/a/amp-1/blogs/aquascaping-guides-and-tips/how-to-get-rid-of-cyanobacteria-in-aquariums)

#### Causes

- Imbalanced Nutrient Levels
	- Prevent with...
		- Floating plants
		- Fast-growing stem plants
- Poor Water Circulation & Oxygenation
	- Check filter flow
	- Get aeration device
- Organic Matter Buildup in Substrate
	- Vacuum substrate

#### Removal

> If doing any form of chemical treatment, you can store your filter media to avoid uncycling the tank

- Manual Removal
- Increase Flow and/or Filtration
	- Mentions a 'powerhead'?
- Adjust Photoperiod
	- As a last-ditch effort, turning off the aquarium light for 3-7 days will starve it, but this has drawbacks
- Chemical Treatment
	- Erythromycin
	- Green Water Labs Algae Control

### pH Lowering

- Reverse Osmosis or Deionized Water
	- Use reverse osmosis (RO) or deionized (DI) water to create the desired pH and provide buffering.
	- Always prepare water and test pH before adding it to your aquarium.
- Driftwood
	- Decorate your aquarium with natural driftwood.
	- Tannins released by driftwood can help lower pH, but keep in mind that it takes a fair amount of driftwood to have the desired effect.
	- One or two small pieces will not do much, especially in a large aquarium or one with strong buffering capacity.
- Peat Moss
	- Add peat moss or peat pellets to your filter.
	- Like driftwood, peat moss contains tannins that lower pH.
	- Use a mesh media bag to keep it contained and use only peat products designed for aquariums.
	- Replenish as needed to maintain the desired pH.
	- The only downside to using peat moss is sometimes it discolors the aquarium water, however, this will soon clear up. Some hobbyists like this “natural tea-look” but, if you have some guests coming over and do not want your aquarium water discolored, you can pre-treat water in a separate container a few days before adding it into your aquarium.
	- To effectively use peat moss to lower the pH, it must stay in your aquarium, as dipping it in now and then will not work.
	- The easiest way to use peat moss is to buy pellets or chunks that you add to your aquarium filter.
	- Unfortunately, there are still no exact dosage instructions, therefore, we recommend you start with a small piece and monitor the pH (with pH strips or a pH meter), adding more if needed.
- Catappa (Indian Almond) Leaves
	- Just like using driftwood and peat moss, catappa leaves slowly release tannins as they decay in the water. In addition to their pH lowering capabilities, it is thought they also contain antibacterial properties, which can help treat fin rot in fry (baby fish). 
	- You can simply place the Indian almond leaves loosely in the water. The water flow will carry them around the aquarium as they decompose, creating little “magic carpets” for any invertebrates to hop on for a ride.
	- If you prefer a tidy aquarium, you can bunch them up using string and place them in the filter, out of sight. If you want to avoid adding them into your aquarium completely, you can add some leaves combined with some aquarium water into a separate container, and pour it in when you perform your water changes. 
	- Indian almond leaves are popular, due to their more-precise dosing measurements. It is estimated that one leaf per 10 gallons of water is plenty to see a gentle difference in lowering the pH
- Soil Substrate
	- Soil is an active substrate, very popular in the set-up of plant aquariums, but also favoured for breeding tanks for soft water shrimp.
	- Due to their cation exchange ability, they remove hardeners from the water, reduce carbonate hardness and lower the pH value.
	- Many Soils even out the water to a pH of about 6.5, which is ideal for most soft water loving fish and shrimp.
	- The effect of the [soil](https://www.aquasabi.com/aquascaping/substrate/soil/) diminishes after time (also dependent on the hardness of the water used initially), and should then be replaced
- Chemical Water Conditioners
- Seachem Purigen
	- Natural (I think) water conditioner.
	- Similar to peat, but doesn't discolour the wayer
